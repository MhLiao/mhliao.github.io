My name is **Minghui Liao (廖明辉)**. I am now a researcher in Huawei Cloud. I received my PhD degree in 2021, supervised by [Professor Xiang Bai](http://122.205.5.5:8071/~xbai/), in [VLR Group](http://www.vlrlab.net/), Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China. 
My recent works are mainly on scene text detection and recognition.
